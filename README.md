# Supply Chain Analytics and Procurement Management

# Overview  :
This project involves using Microsoft Power BI to analyze supply chain and procurement data to identify trends, supplier limitations, product-based supplier consolidation, and minimize cost impact to the company. The Accounts Department maintains invoice-level details of all vendors for each part procured, while the Business Planner collects supplier and part level information separately from the Purchase Department. The goal is to create a dashboard that provides insights into procurement trends, supplier limitations, and product-based supplier consolidation to help the Procurement Department make strategic decisions.

# Technology Used :
Microsoft Power BI

# Business Case

The Accounts Department maintains invoice-level details of all vendors for each part procured. The Business Planner receives invoice data from the Accounts Department and collects supplier and part level information separately from the Purchase Department. The goal is to study the relevant data and identify procurement trends, supplier limitations, product-based supplier consolidation, and minimize cost impact to the company.

# Problem Statement

The collected data is of different years for multiple plants grouped by different business units. The parts are either made of aluminum or ferrous of different raw material grade alloys, with the source being either Tier 1 supplier or Tier 2 supplier. The challenge is to create a dashboard that is insightful on all these factors and can help the Procurement Department make better supply chain strategic decisions.

# Dataset 
# The dataset consists of the following files  :

Material_weights_and_source.xlsx  : Material weights and source data

Report_Master.xlsx  : Report data
 
Supplier_data.xlsx  : Supplier data
 
Additionally, there are visualization files  :

Dataset - Material weights and source.png  : Visualization of material weights and source data
Dataset - Report.png  : Visualization of report data
Dataset - Supplier data.png  : Visualization of supplier data

# Power BI Report
Supply Chain Analytics and Procurement Management.pbix  : Power BI report file containing the dashboard and visualizations.

# Dashboard Features

1. Visualization of procurement trends
2. Analysis of supplier limitations
3. Product-based supplier consolidation
4. Cost impact analysis

# Conclusion
The Supply Chain Analytics and Procurement Management project leverages Microsoft Power BI to analyze supply chain and procurement data, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making by the Procurement Department.
